  bio: {
    summary:
      "I am studying Artificial Intelligence at UET Lahore with a strong interest in software engineering and systems. Most of my projects start with a question or a practical problem, whether that means working with a large dataset, building a terminal tool, or training a model. I enjoy machine learning, Linux, open source, and building software that feels solid and complete.",
    about: [
      "I started programming in Python by writing small automation scripts. Even before writing code, I was always tinkering with hardware, electronics, and home networking. I have always enjoyed taking things apart to understand how they work under the surface and putting them back together.",
      "Building small games in Unity early on sparked my curiosity about software and eventually led me to machine learning, particularly computer vision and NLP. Outside of computing, I care deeply about wildlife conservation and animal welfare, which directly inspired two of my projects: classifying Himalayan species and predicting shelter outcomes.",
